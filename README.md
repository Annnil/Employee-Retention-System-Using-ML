# Employee-Retention-System-Using-ML

## OBJECTIVE
The main objective of the project is to predict on what factors Employees tends to leave their organisation. 
Our Project will helps organisations to figure out how to retain their employees by dealing with the problem which is causing Employees to leave the organisation.
We want to; 
➢ Apply Machine Learning algorithms on this real-world problem like Employee Retention.
➢ Check the results which Machine Learning Algorithms provide by applying it in realworld scenarios.

## SCOPE
The proposed system of the project will figure out the major concerning factors which are resulting Employees to leave their organisation.
The project will predict that the Employee will stay or leave the organisation on the basis of some major factors like;
a. salary
b. promotions in last 5 years (if any)
c. number of projects done
d. satisfaction level
e. work accidents (if any)
